She has studied chamber music with many renowned musicians such as members of the Juilliard Quartet, Emerson Quartet, Cho-Liang Lin, Sylvia Rosenberg, Joseph Kalichstein, Yoheved Kaplinsky, and Jerome Lowenthal. Caroline has also played in masterclasses for legendary cellists and pedagogues including Frans Helmerson, David Finckel, Alan Stepansky, Peter Wiley, Timothy Eddy, and Lynn Harrell.  </p>

            <p>As a soloist, Caroline enjoys playing music from the broad spectrum of classical music history as well as exploring different genres of music. Her most recent project was performing transcriptions of the two Brahms Viola Sonatas, and performing in collaboration with a jazz ensemble.</p>
